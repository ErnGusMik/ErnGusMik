Still in high school, love making personal projects from time to time.

I am proficient in:
- JavaScript (incl. React, Node.js, Express.js, etc.)
- HTML
- CSS
- Flutter
- PostgreSQL
- Python
- C++
- and probably some others, as by the time you're probably reading this, some time has passed since I edited this

Message me on Instagram (@ernestsgm) or find me in the Hack Club Slack (under 18 only ðŸ˜¶)

I'm happy to collaborate on something!
